                            <h2>JENNIFER</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="img/jenThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Jennifer" />
                                I am not quite sure why I like to gloss over the details of how we met, but when people ask, I give them a noncommittal answer. Usually I say we met at a conference. It’s a good enough answer but I tend to forget that there was more. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The unpredictable set of events that pushed me toward this inconsequential conference can only be attributed to "fate". On the day of the conference, I only had enough time to stay for my picture to be taken before I had to leave for class. And while it was short, I’d enough time to realize I wasn’t going to get along with Eric.</p> 
                            <p>
                                He made taking portraits even more painful than it had to be and many times, urged me to open my eyes more. There was not a thread of reason in why we became Facebook friends later but we did, and I figured later, it was one of those things you couldn’t really pin down to rationality. </p>
                            <p>
                                My first real conversation with Eric – on Facebook – happened a whole year later and I found it charming. But once we really got to know each other I was more than charmed; it was like what those fairytale stories promised to be. The difference is, I was not merely reading about them, I was living in it. I, too, experienced those sweet summer days of talking, eating, and finding out things we liked in common.  Surprisingly, we continued to do so, via WeChat while he worked in Bermuda. The weather cooled, but we stayed strong, despite the hovering sense of responsibilities in our last year of undergrad, the temper flares, and the disagreements. </p>
                            <p>
                                The fact is, by December that year, I’d been on this momentum that spurred me headfirst toward love. It really could have ended awfully, even outing total rejection. But – I think – the most enduring charm about Eric was that he truly connected with me and love me back withstanding all those humanly imperfections.<p>
                            <p>
                                And surely there has been a love story more full of wonderment, more freshly original than this one, but mine takes center place because it belongs exclusively to me, to us. At the end of the day, even the wedding itself seems small and irrelevant, because if our feelings toward each other remain, not only as lovers but as friends, always there, always to be relied on for warmth and understanding. Then, that alone would ensure a more beloved story than any other ones I know. </p>

                            <p><img src="img/ericThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Eric" />
                                Before I started talking I must thank every one for coming to our wedding. It was my fault to give you guys such short notice. But I am so glad that I have my best friends here to witness the most important day of my life.</p>

                            <p>I will begin my talk in Mandarin and the rest in English.</p>

                            <p>首先我要感谢我的父亲和母亲。他们养育了我的身体，培育了我的人格。他们引导我认识这个世界上的各种美好。我能在加拿大念书，也归功于他们的一臂之力。我还要感谢易芝的父母。你们是我在加拿大新的家人，请让我正式叫你们一声“爸，妈”。</p>

                            <p>Next I want to talk about Jennifer and me. I owe so much to Jennifer. When I was still in Seattle weeks ago, she arranged all the details of the wedding.</p>

                            <p>I remember very well how we met. It was a conference in which I was the photographer. I took photos of her, many more than I should. I told her I was going to Bermuda. </p>

                            <p>Ah! The Bermuda! When I was working there I had a short trip back to Toronto. That&#8217;s when I really started to know Jennifer. We told each other everything on the first date: including the first kiss and the ex-relationships. I had never gotten along so well with anyone before. We have had fights, but they always ended with hugs and kisses. We sat in each other&#8217;s classes and studied together in our library dates. We had so much fun in our trip to Cuba! My dream came true when I drove her on a scooter near a beach. She is so cute, lovely, kind and understanding.</p>

                            <p>I also want to thank my friends for all the good time we spent together. One day I woke up in the middle of the night and said to Jennifer, &#8220;we must keep in touch with our friends, your friends and my friends!&#8221; She agreed. I am so glad you guys are here.</p>

                            <p>I want to say a last few words before I stop:</p>

                            <p>钱钟书说，婚姻是一座围城，外面的人想进来，里面的人想出去</p>

                            <p>My favourite author wrote, &#8220;marriage is like a castle under siege. People outside want to get in, and people inside wants to get out.&#8221; </p>

                            <p>我觉得婚姻更像是一艘驶向远方的轮船，全家人都在船上，凭着智慧和耐心，去经历风风雨雨和海阔天空。</p>

                            <p>I think marriage is more like a ship sailing to the future. Everyone in the family is on board. We rely on wisdom and patience to sail through hardship, and enjoy the happiness.</p>
