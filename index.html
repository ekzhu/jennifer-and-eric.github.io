                            <h2>JENNIFER</h2>
                            <p>
                                <img src="img/jenThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Jennifer" />
                                I am not quite sure why I like to gloss over the details of how we met, but when people ask, I give them a noncommittal answer. Usually I say we met at a conference. It’s a good enough answer but I tend to forget that there was more. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The unpredictable set of events that pushed me toward this inconsequential conference can only be attributed to "fate". On the day of conference, I only had enough time to stay for my picture to be taken before I had to leave for class. And while it was short, I’d enough time to realize I wasn’t going to get along with Eric.</p> 
                            <p>
                                He made taking portraits even more painful than it had to be and many times, urged me to open my eyes more. There was not a thread of reason in why we became Facebook friends later but we did, and I figured later, it was one of those things you couldn’t really pin down to rationality. </p>
                            <p>
                                My first real conversation with Eric – on Facebook – happened a whole year later and I found it charming. But once we really got to know each other I was more than charmed; it was like what those fairytale stories promised to be. The difference is, I was not merely reading about them, I was living in it. I, too, experienced those sweet summer days of talking, eating, and finding out things we liked in common.  Surprisingly, we continued to do so, via WeChat while he worked in Bermuda. The weather cooled, but we stayed strong, despite the hovering sense of responsibilities in our last year of undergrad, the temper flares, and the disagreements. </p>
                            <p>
                                The fact is, by December that year, I’d been on this momentum that spurred me headfirst toward love. It really could have ended awfully, even outing total rejection. But – I think – the most enduring charm about Eric was that he truly connected with me and love me back withstanding all those humanly imperfections.<p>
                            <p>
                                And surely there has been a love story more full of wonderment, more freshly original than this one, but mine takes center place because it belongs exclusively to me, to us. At the end of the day, even the wedding itself seems small and irrelevant, because if our feelings toward each other remain, not only as lovers but as friends, always there, always to be relied on for warmth and understanding. Then, that alone would ensure a more beloved story than any other ones I know. </p>
